# üêæ HopesAlive: Revolutionizing Animal Rescue

## üêæ Whats is the problem 
Every day, countless animals suffer from injuries or accidents, and often, they go unnoticed or unassisted. Traditional reporting methods are limited, and there is a lack of collaboration among the public, veterinary professionals, and shelters. We need a system that not only facilitates the reporting of these incidents but also provides a way for professionals to respond effectively.


## üêæ What is HopesAlive?  
HopesAlive is a web platform that empowers users to report animal-related incidents by uploading a photo and location details. The system ensures that the relevant NGOs and volunteers in the area are notified, enabling swift action. Volunteers and NGOs can manage incidents collaboratively, track statuses, and communicate seamlessly to save lives and bring aid to animals in need.
